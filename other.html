  <article class="story">
    <p class="info">I sat down and just started writing this.  It was more an excercise in the writing process than trying to make a good story.  As you'll see I start with the end of the story and then try to get to that point.  This might make the plot not so great, but it was interesting writing it.</p>
    <p>
    	One more minute.  That’s all it would’ve taken, one more minute.  Maybe even 30 seconds.  If I hadn’t stumbled on the sidewalk, if I hadn’t spent so much time looking for the right words...  I would’ve been fine.  But now I’m sitting in a holding cell contemplating my life.  No, I’m not a criminal.  I’m just a regular guy in his mid-20’s who made one little mistake.  And the more I think about it, the more I should’ve seen it coming.  The more I realize I could have prevented this.
    </p><p>
	Ok, so maybe I’m not exactly a regular guy.  Two years ago, I was in hiding.  It started with a girl (of course).  Or maybe I should say it ended with a girl.  And started with her fiancé.  I swear it’s not my fault.  I didn’t know (I didn’t ask) and I stopped as soon as I did (well, soon after).  Who knew such a sweet kid would be with such a rough-and-tumble guy.  I guess those types always go after the macho tough guys. 
    </p><p>
	So I got out of town.  I packed a single bag, emptied my meager bank account, and got on a bus.  It seemed kind of adventurous at the time… like a movie.  Well, unlike what those movies show, I ended up living in an abandoned warehouse in East Chicago.  I spent the first month looking for a job, then quickly realized I had to find a more immediate solution.  I know what you’re thinking, but don’t forget… I’m not a criminal!  Maybe I took a few scraps off of a plate from Pierre’s when the middle-aged couple paid there bill and left, but that’s hardly a crime.  Maybe I “borrowed” a shirt or two from the Quick-Clean Laundromat, but I was desperate.  You learn a lot when your life depends on it.
    </p><p>
	There are a lot of interesting homeless people in Chicago.  I mean, there are a lot of violent and/or crazy homeless people too, but some people are just unlucky.  Some of those guys on the streets were among the cleverest people I’ve ever met, yet somehow not clever enough to get back on their feet.  I guess some of them didn’t want to fit back into society.  Some of them were against conforming, and honestly, the way they lived made me truly believe they didn’t need to.  Like Chris.  Chris was a year or two older than me, skinny, black, and sharp as a whip.  He cursed every single “suit” that walked past him under his breath, mostly because he knew he could put them to shame with his wits.  Yet for some reason they thought they were better than him.  Chris could talk his way into or out of any situation.  One time I witnessed him get a tent for free with an expired coupon and a well-worded rant of equal parts politics and morality.
    </p><p>
	Anyway, Chris is not the point of this tale.  I’m not actually sure what the point of this is, what I expect you or anyone else to learn from this, but I’ll move on since we’ve made it this far.  Living in a warehouse, with no heat, no shower, no toilet, no running water at all, is not an easy life to get used to.  I didn’t have it perfect back at home, but damn, did I appreciate what I had once I didn’t have it anymore.  If you’ve ever been to Chicago, you would know heat quickly becomes a necessity.  For the first two weeks I woke up to rats scampering across my chest.  I barely slept.  And after two weeks… I just learned to sleep through it.  I eventually got a job loading trucks at a big electronics store.  After a month of that, I found an apartment.  The water was always cold, but it ran.  The heat sucked, but I appreciated every little bit I could get.  Things were starting to look up until it just hit me one day.
    </p><p>
	I woke up and she was running through my head.  I had dreamt about her all night, and unfortunately these weren’t the kind of dreams you forget as soon as you open your eyes.  This was a dream that runs through your head every waking minute the next day, images that you see every time you close your eyes.  The exact point of realization that you hadn’t even remotely gotten over her; you just forgot how obsessed you were.  And then I heard her voice or saw the back of her head on every crowded street.  Every song was her.  Days turned to weeks, even months, and time apparently didn’t heal all.  I was going crazy and there was only one way to get past this.
    </p><p>
	I took the same bus back.  It was like reverse déjà vu… a single bag, a handful of cash, and nothing but ideas to work with.  In hindsight, I should plan ahead more.  This seems to be a theme in my life.  I guess I’m just into the thrill of jumping in head first and not knowing what happens next.  Well at this point I’m done with thrills; I just want to go home.  I want out of this cell.  Anyway, we’re not there yet… I’m getting ahead of myself.
    </p><p>
	So I pulled into town and instantly got cold feet.  I mean, what was I going to say?  I’d been gone so long, without any communication, and all of a sudden I’m supposed to run in and shout “I just thought about you and I can’t get you out of my head” like a crazy person?  Not to mention, I didn’t exactly know where to find her, if she was even there, what her life had been like while I was gone…  It was late, so I decided the only thing to do was get a place to stay and start tomorrow.
    </p><p>
	I woke up confused.  I could only think about one thing for so long, and now that I was here I suddenly forgot what I was doing.  And once I remembered, I didn’t know how to feel about it.  I had been infatuated with a single idea, and suddenly I was asking myself if it was really worth it, if it could really work out.   I decided I needed to go for a walk and clear my head, so I grabbed my jacket and headed out with a brain full of questions I couldn’t even make out.
    </p><p>
	The first thing I tackled was how much time I had.  I know I’m usually pretty spur of the moment, but I can plan when I need to.  And after my experiences in Chicago, I knew how important it was to manage my money.  I figured with food and the motel I was staying at, I could last about a week, give or take a day.  Most people would freak a little upon that analysis, but I’d been in much worse positions.  Then of course that got me thinking about food, so I stopped by a grocery store.  I knew exactly what to get, eating had long ceased to be about my palate and was now just a means of efficiently continuing to live.  I didn’t even want good tasting food; it was as if my taste buds had slowly disappeared.  If I had had any extra money, I would have spent it on clothes or something useful that would last me.  Food was such a fleeting pleasure.  I guess Chicago had made me a complete utilitarian.
    </p><p>
	Anyway, back to what really matters: the most important scene of my life, the most important grocery store I will ever step foot in and the image that will forever be inscribed on the back of my brain.  I was studying the nutrition facts on my breakfast (as we know, the back of the packaging being infinitely more significant than the front), when I looked up to hand my food to a goddess.  It was as if light emanated from her very being, with a perfect smile and flawless skin.  Thinking back to that moment, I imagine I stood there with my mouth agape, probably looking like an idiot for far too long, before reaching into my pocket and counting out exact change like the unworthy Neanderthal I am in comparison to that blonde beauty.  I’m a little ashamed to say that that was the last time I really thought about what had brought me back to this town.
    </p><p>
	I left the store in a bigger daze then when I had entered.  I had a new goal now.  But wait, I couldn’t even possibly hope to have any chance with that stunning creature back there.  I walked back to my room and spent the rest of the day pacing.  It might be hard to imagine an entire day spent pacing around a room until it happens to you.  I just thought about what to do: what I could do, what I should do.  I thought about everything that could go wrong and every possible beautiful future I could share with the cashier from the grocery store.  It didn’t even seem that ridiculous at the time.
    </p><p>
	Suddenly I realized it was dinnertime and I was starving.  I considered going back to the grocery store, but I doubted she would be there and I didn’t want to seem desperate if she was (as if she would have remembered me, ha!).  Instead, I walked across the street to some fast food place and absentmindedly ordered the first thing on the menu.  I was too infatuated with that face that wouldn’t leave me to worry about things like money right now.  After dinner I could think a little more clearly and I decided I needed a plan.  For once in my life I was going to think things through and do it right.
    </p><p>
	So here’s the plan:  become a regular at the store, maybe even apply for a job there (if not, I had to start looking at a means of income/food in some fashion tomorrow), get some face time, a few casual conversations in passing, find out what she likes, mainly just make sure she acknowledges my existence.  Then in two weeks from today, I ask her out.  There has to be a deadline, or I’d surely chicken out.  I mean, I’m already having second thoughts… how could I even image someone like her would ever… never mind.  Think positive thoughts.  This was going to be my life now, or at least for the next two weeks.
    </p><p>
	Now I know what you’re thinking.  You know how this story ends, and that plan doesn’t seem all that reckless.  I mean, surely it’s not going to work, but it shouldn’t end up with me recounting it to you from jail.  Well you know what they say, the best laid plans of mice and men are gonna get messed up.
    </p><p>
	I won’t bore you with too many details about the next two weeks.  The grocery store wasn’t hiring (but it gave me an excellent chance to first talk to the cashier) so I found a part time job sorting through donations at a charity thrift shop to get enough money to at least see my plan through to the end.  I subtly learned her schedule.  She didn’t work on the weekends, which made my time go excruciatingly slow on those days, but she worked every weekday morning and afternoon.  Oh, and her name was Heather.  Sweet, lovely Heather.  And she liked classic rock and horses and she took classes at a community college at night to be a nurse.  I can’t even describe the dreams I had of her as a nurse when I found that last part out.  It wasn’t a lot of information, but it was enough.  She knew who I was, so that part of the mission was successful at least.  Then came the fateful day; one fateful, unfortunately, for reasons other than what I intended.
    </p><p>
	I woke up early; in fact I didn’t really sleep.  I spent an hour pacing and staring in the chipped mirror disgusted at how awful I looked and wishing I had slept.  I took a shower, looked at myself in the mirror again and decided I needed to do some pushups and sit-ups.  I’m not sure if I really thought this would help me get a date, I think it was more of a psychological thing to make myself feel better, to pump myself up.  Then I had to shower again.  Then I got worried that showering so much would dry out my skin and make me look worse.  Things were getting bad.  I decide I just needed to take a walk around the block and clear my head; not think about things for a few minutes so I could come back level-headed and concentrate on the situation at hand.  So that’s what I did.
    </p><p>
	I walked to the corner and turned left, concentrating on my breathing in almost a meditative state.  My head was buzzing and I couldn’t quite push it all out of my mind, but at least it became a general sense of worry, not specific stabs of panic.  I took another left.  I tripped on a crack in the sidewalk.  This actually got me watching where I was going, which was kind of a nice distraction from everything.  I looked around and saw an elderly woman walking a small, fluffy dog.  I don’t know why, but it made me laugh a little.  I turned again.  I could see the final left turn ahead of me, the point at which I would have to start facing everything once again, but I told myself to not think about it, allow myself to have those last few steps of calm.  I reached the end of the block.  The gears in my head started whirling faster than ever.  I reached my door; I was thinking about everything and yet not thinking about anything in particular.  I looked at the mirror again, flattened my hair, decided I didn’t like that and messed it all up, got frustrated with myself for doing that, and finally got it to “good enough.”  I brushed my teeth.  I put on the clothes I had been planning on wearing for over a week now (I couldn’t wear them until the last second to prevent anything from happening to them).  I left my room.
    </p><p>
	The grocery store was only a few minutes away, but it seemed much further that morning.  Everything was in slow motion and yet I wished it would slow down even more.  I almost ran into a guy handing out coupons on the corner and narrowly avoided falling.  I’m not usually so clumsy, but I guess I have my moments.  Then I started thinking an oaf like myself shouldn’t even be trying this… But no, stay strong.  This is not the time for that.  You might be wondering why I wasn’t rehearsing any lines at this point.  Well, I had thought about what I was going to say for a while, but decided last night that my best chance was to play it cool and do it on the spot.  I know, you think I’m an idiot, but I promise you I do my best thinking on my feet.  Plus I didn’t want to throw out any stale rehearsed lines, I wanted to sound like I was just extending an invite, on the off chance she was free and interested.  I was in front of the store now.  One last final breath, and in I stepped.
    </p><p>
	I didn’t go straight there; I perused produce and studied the snacks until I found exactly what I wanted (I don’t even remember what it was I brought up to the cash register now).  I waited patiently behind the slowest grocery store patron in all of history.  Finally, it was my turn.  She told me the price in such a soft, sweet voice and even used my name.  I paid.  Now was my chance.
    </p><p>
	I looked up slowly, and locked eyes for a second.  Immediately, my gaze dropped back down to my hands.  This isn’t going well so far.  I took a quick, silent breath and went for it.
    </p><p>
	“Hey Heather.”
    </p><p>
	“Nice to see you this morning.  How are you?”
    </p><p>
	“Good.  I’m… yeah, good.  How are… How’s your morning going? [Ugh.  This is not going as well as I had hoped.  I need to find some courage from somewhere and just do it.]”
    </p><p>
	“Pretty good.”
    </p><p>
	“Hey, so I was thinking, if you’re free sometime like this week or this weekend, do you want to maybe get some coffee [I rarely actually drink coffee] or hang out or something.  Just like if you’re free or want to or whatever. [What a regular Casanova I am.]”
    </p><p>
	“Um… [The longest pause of my life.  I’m sure it wasn’t actually that long, but it seemed like time just stopped.] …sure.  How about Saturday?”
    </p><p>
	“Yeah, cool.  You don’t have to if you don’t want to though.  [Thinking back to this still makes me cringe.  I got the go-ahead, just walk away while you’re ahead dummy!]”
    </p><p>
	Heather gave a little laugh and smiled.  I’m still not sure if it was a “how cute” smile or a “this is so awkward” smile.  Ok now I just had to finish the conversation and get out of there.
    </p><p>
	“Sorry.  So, wanna meet outside of the store around six?”
    </p><p>
	“Six sounds great.”
    </p><p>
	I looked up and met her eyes for the first time since this conversation started.  I would have changed so many things about this interaction if I had another chance at it, but it didn’t matter now I was successful!  I smiled, took my food, and turned away.  My heart was still racing.  I felt the smile on my face grow even bigger.  I was in the doorway when I heard a scream.
    </p><p>
	I turned around and saw two things: my date for Saturday looking terrified and a gun.  What happened next remains a bit hazy for me.  I guess I was just overly-defensive of this girl.  I was on the guy at the register before he even saw me.  The gun was out of his hand immediately.  He ran, but I ran after him.  I hit him.  I hit him again.  I don’t know how many times I hit him.  I had tunnel-vision.  There was blood.  Lots of blood.  Then he was limp.  Then there were cops.  Then there were questions.  Lots of questions.
    </p><p>
	Why did I intervene?  I don’t know.  Why did I care if he robbed the place?  I don’t know.  Why didn’t I let him go after he lost the gun?  I don’t know.  Why did I have to beat him up?  Why didn’t I stop?  What was I thinking?  Was it all for her?  Would she think I was psycho now?  Would she think I was brave?  Did we still have a date on Saturday?
    </p><p>
	So that’s my story.  It’s hard to claim self defense when he left unarmed and I ran after him.  I can’t quite explain it to the cops.  I can’t quite explain it to myself.  I can’t even quite remember all of what happened.  I guess girls just make you do some pretty crazy things.  I think they don’t really know what to do with me.  I’m just hoping that they let me go before Saturday night.  And that Heather still wants to go out.  Maybe this will be the funny story of how we met that we tell our kids?  Maybe I am insane…
    </p><p>
	So I guess the moral of the story is don’t let your obsession with a girl make you assault an unarmed man.  Or maybe the moral is don’t get so obsessed.  Or don’t come looking for an ex all because of a dream.  Or don’t get mixed up with a girl with a boyfriend who has a temper in the first place.  Most likely, there is no moral to this story.  It’s just a tale, a bunch of words that just describes how I got here.
