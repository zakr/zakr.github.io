    <h2>Welcome to Camp Wildcat!</h2> 
  
    <p>Camp Wildcat seeks to build positive relationships between University of Arizona students and underprivileged children in the Greater Tucson community. Our programs provide children with opportunities to have fun, interact closely with positive role models, explore diverse topics in a hands-on learning environment, enhance their own self image, and view higher education and general success as attainable goals. Activities include weekend camps, a week-long summer camp in the Grand Canyon, day activities, mock camps in the UMC Pediatrics Ward, backpacking trips for middle school students, and other special events for children.</p>
    <p>Camp Wildcat embodies the concept of service learning by providing its members with the opportunity to learn valuable interpersonal skills such as leadership, grant writing, team building, planning, and educating. Extensive fundraising including our annual auction, along with significant networking with both the Tucson Community and the University of Arizona allow Camp Wildcat to continue to positively influence children’s lives into the future.</p>

We also conduct several day activities with various groups of kids during the school year. Since all of our activities are free to the kids we work with, we hold multiple fundraisers each year to pay for the camps and day activities that we run.

Before you volunteer at any activity working with children you must be fingerprinted with Camp Wildcat to check your criminal background for crimes against children.

  <h3 id="q1">Who is in Camp Wildcat?</h3>
  <p>There are more than 100 Camp Wildcat volunteers, mostly undergraduates of the University of Arizona. Camp Wildcat is open to any University of Arizona student and does not discriminate on the basis of age, color, ethnicity, gender, national origin, disability, handicap, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, veteran status or unique individual style.</p>
  
  <h3 id="q2">What does Camp Wildcat do?</h3>
  <p>Camp Wildcat is a group of UA students that runs cost-free activities for Tucson youth. We run three weekend camps each semester for kids. We also conduct several day activities with various groups of kids during the school year. Since all of our activities are free to the kids we work with, we hold multiple fundraisers each year to pay for the camps and day activities that we run. We also have socials to give our volunteers the opportunity to meet other students on campus and develop group cohesiveness.</p>
    
  <h3 id="q3">How can I get involved in Camp Wildcat?</h3>
   <p>If you are a UA student, you can be involved in Camp Wildcat. The easiest way to get started is to come to our general club meetings. Check the <a href="http://campwildcat.org/members">CW members page</a> for up-to-date meeting times and locations. During the school year we meet once a week. At our meetings you will learn about all of our upcoming events and you will have a chance to meet other members. Meetings are open to any student, and members pay no dues. You can volunteer with us as much or as little as you like. Learn more by exploring at the <a href="http://campwildcat.org/members">CW members page</a>. If you know you would like to volunteer with us, sign up on our website by clicking on the "Join CW" link that is in the upper left hand corner of the yellow box in the <a href="http://campwildcat.org/members">members page</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="q4">What is required to volunteer?</h3>
  <p>Before a camp you must apply to the camp on-line and sign-up for an interview with the camp director. The camp director will decide who is able to go on camp. Before you volunteer at any activity working with children you must be fingerprinted with Camp Wildcat to check your criminal background for crimes against children. This is a safeguard to protect the children we work with. Fingerprinting and interviews are not required to attend fundaisers, socials, or other events without kids.</p>
    
    <h3 id="q5">I can´t come to meetings, can I still volunteer?</h3>
    <p>YES! Absolutely, we would love to have you volunteer with us! Meeting attendance is not required to volunteer at our fundraisers, or as a counselor at our camps or day activities. Simply check the members page of this web site for the information on the event(s) that you would like to attend, and let the person running the event know that you would like to come. In the case of a camp you will have to fill out an application on-line and meet the camp director for an interview, the application and interview sign-ups are also on-line at our members web page.</p>
    
    <h3 id="q6">I´m not a UA student, can I still volunteer?</h3>
    <p>In most cases, yes. We accept non-UA students as volunteers on a case-by-case basis. You will need to talk to the board at a general meeting or by e-mail.</p>
      
    <h3 id="q7">Who runs Camp Wildcat?</h3>
    <p>Camp Wildcat is an organization officially recognized by the <a href="http://www.arizona.edu"> University of Arizona</a>. We are entirely staffed, directed, and operated by student volunteers. The general membership elects a <a href="http://www.campwildcat.org/board/">Board of Directors</a> each year to serve as our decision-making body as well as our finance board. The board is advised by University of Arizona staff members. Camp Wildcat has no paid staff.</p>
    
    <h3 id="q8">My child has been invited to Camp Wildcat. What is this all about?</h3>
    <p>You can find information for parents, kids, and teachers <a href="http://www.campwildcat.org/campers">on this page</a>.</p>
      
    <h3 id="q9">How can I send my child to Camp Wildcat?</h3> 
      <p>For each event, Camp Wildcat selects a school or group to work with based on need. We try to provide opportunities for fun activities that the kids we work with might not otherwise have. If you are aware of an organization which would benefit from camping or playing with Camp Wildcat for an hour, day or week, please drop a line to <a href="mailto:mail@campwildcat.org">mail@campwildcat.org</a>! We can not guarantee that we will be able to host an event for your group, but we will do our best.</p>
